    <p class="infotext"><b>Welcome to the landing page of the new game Heros of the Element. This website consists of information about the
      builders, and how to install and play this game. All information will be coming soon! This is a multiplayer game
      or
      at least it is a feature that will be coming soon, and this game will be released in either 2026, or 2027. Looking
      foward to it, and anyone in beta will get some sort of admin powers, so make sure to play and create an account in
      the first year! Also if you are interested in helping, ask one of the managers and they will add you to the
      document. These admin powers have been discussed among credited people and we have decided that anyone who played in BETA will get special armor with two of any armor effects, and they will give a set bonus! Join the BETA. Until release, we will give you updates, have fun and be a gamer! After being on pause for some time, this game has work starting again. It will have a different feel than planned before.</b></p>
